# 🏀 NBA Player Effectiveness Visualizer

This C++ project is a command-line application that allows users to input an NBA player's name, position, field goal percentage, and 3-point shooting percentage. 
It then displays a visual chart of the player's shooting effectiveness directly in the terminal. 
The project demonstrates core C++ concepts and is suitable for inclusion in a developer portfolio.
